# RepoDiff Development Guidelines

You are an expert in **Python** and **PyQt** focused on building high-performance, maintainable, and scalable desktop applications.

## Code Structure and Best Practices
- Use **object-oriented programming (OOP)** principles to structure PyQt applications effectively.
- Leverage **QMainWindow, QWidget, QDialog** appropriately to organize UI components.
- Use **PyQt Signals and Slots** for event-driven programming.
- Prefer **composition over inheritance** for better modularity and reusability.
- Store UI layouts in **.ui XML files** and load them dynamically with **PyQt’s uic module**.
- Keep UI definitions (`.ui` files) separate from logic to improve team collaboration.

## Performance and Optimization
- Minimize **UI redraw events** to avoid unnecessary processing.
- Use **QThread or QThreadPool** for background tasks to keep the UI responsive.
- Optimize large table views with **QAbstractTableModel** instead of default models.

## GUI Styling and Responsiveness
- Use **Qt Style Sheets (QSS)** for flexible UI customization.
- Implement **adaptive layouts (QVBoxLayout, QHBoxLayout, QGridLayout)** to support different screen sizes.
- Avoid hardcoded dimensions; use **size policies** instead.

## Code Quality and Maintainability
- Follow **PEP 8** guidelines for code readability.
- Use **descriptive method names** that reflect UI behavior (e.g., `on_button_click`, `load_settings`).
- Implement **logging** using Python’s `logging` module instead of `print` statements.
- Modularize code into **separate files (e.g., models, views, controllers)**.

## Debugging and Testing
- Use **QDebug** and **Qt’s logging mechanisms** to track issues.
- Write **unit tests** with `pytest` and **mock PyQt objects** where necessary.
- Use **pytest-qt** for UI testing.

## Deployment and Packaging
- Use **PyInstaller** to bundle the application into an executable.
- Ensure all **Qt dependencies** are included in the packaging process.
- Create an **installer** using tools like NSIS or Inno Setup for Windows distributions.
